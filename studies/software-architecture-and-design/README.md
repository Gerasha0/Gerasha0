# üèóÔ∏è Software Architecture and Design

This repository contains coursework and laboratory works for the Software Architecture and Design course, focusing on system design principles, architectural patterns, and practical implementation of complex software systems.

## üìö Course Overview

The course covers essential concepts in software architecture including:
- Software design patterns and architectural styles
- System architecture modeling and documentation
- Multi-tier and distributed system design
- API design and implementation
- Database integration and data access patterns
